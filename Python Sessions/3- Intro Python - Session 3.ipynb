    "In the previous sessions, we dove into detail on NumPy and its ``ndarray`` object and matplotlib, which provides efficient storage and manipulation of dense typed arrays and Visualization in Python.\n",
    "Here we'll build on this knowledge by looking in detail at the data structures provided by the Pandas library.\n",
    "Pandas is a newer package built on top of NumPy, and provides an efficient implementation of a ``DataFrame``.\n",
    "``DataFrame``s are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels, and often with heterogeneous types and/or missing data.\n",
    "As well as offering a convenient storage interface for labeled data, Pandas implements a number of powerful data operations familiar to users of both database frameworks and spreadsheet programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw, NumPy's ``ndarray`` data structure provides essential features for the type of clean, well-organized data typically seen in numerical computing tasks.\n",
    "While it serves this purpose very well, its limitations become clear when we need more flexibility (e.g., attaching labels to data, working with missing data, etc.) and when attempting operations that do not map well to element-wise broadcasting (e.g., groupings, pivots, etc.), each of which is an important piece of analyzing the less structured data available in many forms in the world around us.\n",
    "Pandas, and in particular its ``Series`` and ``DataFrame`` objects, builds on the NumPy array structure and provides efficient access to these sorts of \"data munging\" tasks that occupy much of a data scientist's time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with pandas, you will need to get comfortable with its two workhorse data structures: Series and DataFrame. While they are not a universal solution for every problem, they provide a solid, easy-to-use basis for most applications.\n",

    "A dictionary is a structure that maps arbitrary keys to a set of arbitrary values, and a ``Series`` is a structure which maps typed keys to a set of typed values.<br>\n",
    "This typing is important: just as the type-specific compiled code behind a NumPy array makes it more efficient than a Python list for certain operations, the type information of a Pandas ``Series`` makes it much more efficient than Python dictionaries for certain operations.<br><br>\n",
