# Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (on Mac) or *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* (on Windows).

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I* (on Mac) or *Ctrl+Alt+I* (on Windows).


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

You can download and install packages with `install.packages("The name of package")`.

# Basic of learning

In this part we talk about basic elements of R programming.

## How to Print

```{r}

```

## Data Types (Classes)

In R, data types (or classes) define the kind of data stored in variables. Here are the most common data types in R:

| **Class**   | **Description**                           | **Example**               | **Code Example**                 |
|:------------|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| `numeric`   | Represents decimal or whole numbers        | 3.14, 42, -7.8            | `x <- 3.14; class(x)`             |
| `character` | Represents text strings                    | "Hello", "R Programming"  | `z <- "Hello"; class(z)`          |
| `logical`   | Represents Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE)  | TRUE, FALSE               | `is_valid <- TRUE; class(is_valid)` |
| `complex`   | Represents complex numbers                 | 2+3i, 1-4i                | `c <- 2 + 3i; class(c)`           |
| `list`      | Represents a collection of different types | A list of numbers, text   | `lst <- list(1, "Hello", TRUE); class(lst)` |

```{r}

```

## Arithmetic Operators

| Symbol | Task Performed |
|:----:|:---:|
| +  | Addition |
| -  | Subtraction |
| /  | division |
| *  | multiplication |
| **  | to the power of |
| ^  | to the power of |
| %%  | modulus |
| %/%  | floor division |


```{r}


```

**We can save values in variables:**
```{r}

```

In R programming, code runs line by line, with only the last assignment determining the final value of a variable.

```{r}

```


## Relational Operators

| Symbol | Task Performed |
|:----:  |:---:|
|<-	     |Assignment|
|=	     |Assignment|
|assign()|Assignment|
|==      |True, if it is equal|
|!=      |True, if not equal to|
|<	     |less than|
|>	     |greater than|
|<=      |less than or equal to|
|>=      |greater than or equal to|


```{r}

```

**you can use below command to get special values:**

```{r}

```

**you can write comment with # :**
```{r}

```

**you can creat sequence numbers with below command:**

This work like *arange* in numpy pakage in Python
```{r}

```
This work like *linspace* in numpy pakage in Python
```{r}

```

Replicate function:
```{r}

```


## Loops
### if , elif

```{r}

```

### for loops

```{r}

```


### while loops


```{r}

```


**Use break and next in loops**

```{r}

```



## function
```{r}

```


\newpage
# Vetors
The most common way to creat vectors is to use function `c()`.
```{r}

```

**Join vectors**

```{r}

```

You can find _lenght_ of vectors with _lenght()_ function:
```{r}

```

## Vector Indexing

```{r}

```
Use for loops for access to elemets of vectors

```{r}

```
Use index:
```{r}

```

## Matching Operator

```{r}

```
## Vector Arithmetic's

```{r}

```

```{r}

```


## Vector Methods

```{r}

```

```{r}

```
## Logical Vector

```{r}

```

```{r}

```


## Factors
- Used to represent categorical data
- Treated as integer vector, having a label
- Factors are self describing

```{r}
x <- c('Male', "Female", "Male", 'Male', "Female")
```

## Mathematical Function in R

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Random Number in R

```{r} 

```

\newpage
# Matrix

## Creat Matrix

Matrix are 2-dimentsional vectors and Dimensianal attribute is of lenght 2 (rows and columns). We should to know that Matrix contain elemts of same type.

```{r}

```

## Matrix diag

like `numpy.full` in python

```{r}

```

like `numpy.diag` in python

```{r}

```

for find the elements of diagonal of matrix:

```{r}

```

## Matrix: Naming Rows & Columns

```{r}

```

## Matrix Indexing

Indexing in R programming is similar to Python.

```{r}

```

You can change values in matrix.

```{r}

```
## Matrix: `rbine()` and `cbind()` functions

You can combine matrices with `rbine()` and `cbind()` functions. 

At first, we want to combine the matrices from the row.
```{r}

```
After that, we want to combine the matrices from the columns.

```{r}

```

Relational Operators in Matrics:

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,1) , nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
B <- matrix(c(3,1,2,4,2,1,5,1,2), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)


```

 
Like `numpy.transpose()` or `.T` in python

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,1,4,2,3) , nrow=3, ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)

```
## Matrix Specific Functions

```{r}

```

\newpage
# Lists

## Creat list
`Lists` are also collecting of data and another kind of data storage. Lists can contain elemnts of any type of R object and these elements of list don't need be same type. You can creat list by using `list()` function.

```{r}

```
Creat list with vectors
```{r}

```

## List subset Operator

```{r}

```

## Lists Concatenation

```{r}

```
